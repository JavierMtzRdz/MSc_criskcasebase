# Penalized Competing Risks Models for High-Dimensional Data

Repository with my code and my final report for my MSc. thesis

- The stochastic gradient descent to solve for the multinomial regression coefficients is in the `mtool` package of functions 

The commented sample script with comments can be found in the `sample_script` with the src folder containing some additional helper functions (that need to eventually be integrated into a package). 
This paper is also useful to understand the simulated data: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610918.2016.1175621?journalCode=lssp20](Link to Paper)
