\chapter{Preface}

This thesis is original, unpublished work by the author under the supervision of Prof. Gabriela V. Cohen Freue. This thesis is a collaborative product with the CANSII-CRT research group. The research topic was proposed by Prof. Gabriela V. Cohen Freue, in collaboration with Dr. Sahir Bhatnagar, and Dr. Maxime Turgeon. The casebase framework was proposed by Dr. James A. Hanley and Dr. Olli S. Miettinen, and the software was implemented by Dr. Sahir Bhatnagar and Dr. Maxime Turgeon. The optimization for the penalized multinomial regression model used is not currently part of the \texttt{casebase} package and was written by Dr. Yi Lian, with modifications made by the author to correctly fit the penalty functions. The author also solely contributed additional functions for the fitting of the penalized model. All empirical studies and the data analysis were designed and carried out by the author in discussion with Prof. Gabriela V. Cohen Freue. All text and code for the experiments in the thesis were written by the author, aside from the use of \texttt{R} packages that were developed by other authors and obtained from the Comprehensive \texttt{R} Archived Network (CRAN).
